# Tic_Tac_Toe

This is the first game that I have made. It is a classical game named Tic Tac Toe. 

The rules of the game are standard. Nothing new there. 

Some things that are worth mentioning are that when there is a winner, the fields where there are the three winning signs turn green. 
In case there is a draw, all the fields turn orange.
